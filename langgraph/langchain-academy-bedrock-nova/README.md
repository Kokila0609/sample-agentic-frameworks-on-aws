# LangChain Academy - AWS Bedrock Nova Edition

## Introduction

Welcome to LangChain Academy with AWS Bedrock Nova! This repository contains the complete LangChain Academy course materials, specifically adapted to work with AWS Bedrock Nova models instead of OpenAI. 

**This is a standalone repository** - you don't need to clone the original LangChain Academy repository. All course materials have been modified to use AWS Bedrock Nova models and include the necessary configuration for AWS integration.

The course teaches you how to build agent and multi-agent applications using LangGraph, LangChain's framework for creating controllable and reliable AI workflows. Each module builds progressively on the previous one, taking you from basic concepts to advanced production-ready implementations.

## Setup

### Python version

To get the most out of this course, please ensure you're using Python 3.11 or later. 
This version is required for optimal compatibility with LangGraph. If you're on an older version, 
upgrading will ensure everything runs smoothly.
```
python3 --version
```

### Clone this repository
```
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd langchain-academy
```

### Create an environment and install dependencies
#### Mac/Linux/WSL
```
$ python3 -m venv lc-academy-env
$ source lc-academy-env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Windows Powershell
```
PS> python3 -m venv lc-academy-env
PS> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
PS> lc-academy-env\scripts\activate
PS> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### AWS Bedrock Configuration

This repository has been specifically configured to work with AWS Bedrock Nova models. The key changes include:

- **Dependencies**: `langchain-aws` is included in requirements.txt for Bedrock integration
- **Model Configuration**: All code examples use `ChatBedrock` with Nova Pro models (`us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0`)
- **Environment Setup**: AWS credentials configuration is built into the setup process

**Prerequisites:**
1. An AWS account with access to Bedrock Nova models
2. Appropriate IAM permissions for Bedrock model access
3. AWS credentials configured (access key or IAM role)

### Setting up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# LangSmith (for tracing and monitoring)
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true

# Tavily (for web search in Module 4)
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key

# AWS Bedrock Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
```

**Important**: Replace all placeholder values with your actual API keys and credentials.

### Copy environment variables to studio directories

For convenience, a script has been provided to copy the `.env` file to all studio directories:

```bash
chmod +x copy_env.sh
./copy_env.sh
```

This will copy the `.env` file from the root directory to all studio directories in the project, ensuring LangGraph Studio can access your credentials.

## Getting Started

### Running notebooks
If you don't have Jupyter set up, follow installation instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install).
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### API Keys Setup

**LangSmith (Recommended for tracing):**
- Sign up for LangSmith [here](https://smith.langchain.com/)
- LangSmith provides excellent tracing and monitoring for your LangGraph applications
- Set `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` and `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true` in your `.env` file
- Learn more about LangSmith [here](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith)

**Tavily API (Required for Module 4):**
- Tavily Search API is used for web search capabilities in research assistant examples
- Sign up for an API key [here](https://tavily.com/) - offers a generous free tier
- Set `TAVILY_API_KEY` in your `.env` file
- Only needed for Module 4 lessons involving web search

**AWS Bedrock:**
- Ensure you have access to Bedrock Nova models in your AWS account
- Configure your AWS credentials (access key/secret key or IAM role)
- Set your preferred AWS region (us-west-2 recommended for Nova model availability)

### Set up LangGraph Studio

* LangGraph Studio is a custom IDE for viewing and testing agents.
* Studio can be run locally and opened in your browser on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
* See documentation [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_studio/#local-development-server) on the local Studio development server and [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/local-studio/#run-the-development-server). 
* Graphs for LangGraph Studio are in the `module-x/studio/` folders.
* To start the local development server, run the following command in your terminal in the `/studio` directory each module:

```
langgraph dev
```

You should see the following output:
```
- ðŸš€ API: http://127.0.0.1:2024
- ðŸŽ¨ Studio UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024
- ðŸ“š API Docs: http://127.0.0.1:2024/docs
```

Open your browser and navigate to the Studio UI: `https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024`.
